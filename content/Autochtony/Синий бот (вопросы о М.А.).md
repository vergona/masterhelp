Alright, let's break down the classification and accessibility of Martial Arts across the three editions of Exalted, highlighting the key differences and providing source references where possible. It's a complex topic, and the rules evolved significantly over the editions.

## 1st Edition: (Simplicity and Broad Strokes)

•  Classification: In 1st Edition, Martial Arts were relatively straightforward. Styles were not as rigidly defined as in later editions. There was primarily one category of Martial Arts: Charms that enhanced combat abilities.
•  Accessibility:
  •  Mortals: Mortals could learn a limited number of Martial Arts Charms, usually those considered "lesser" or focused on more practical skills. They often required training from a master.
  •  Terrestrial Exalted: Terrestrials (Dragon-Blooded) had broader access to Martial Arts, particularly those that reflected their element and the traditions of their Houses. However, mastering Celestial Martial Arts was typically beyond their reach.
  •  Celestial Exalted: Celestials (Solars, Lunars, Sidereals, Abyssals) had the most access to Martial Arts, including the powerful Celestial Martial Arts that granted access to superhuman abilities.
•  Key Features:
  •  Charm Trees: Martial Arts Charms were organized into branching "trees," requiring the purchase of prerequisites to learn more advanced techniques.
  •  Elemental Affinities: Some Martial Arts styles were aligned with specific elements, granting bonuses to characters with the corresponding elemental affinity.
•  Sources:
  •  Exalted (1st Edition Core Rulebook): The basic rules for Charms, including Martial Arts, are found here. (Pages will vary depending on printing, but look for the Charm chapter).
  •  Savage Seas: Adds a new martial arts style.
  •  Games of Divinity: Adds a new martial arts style.

## 2nd Edition: (Expanded Styles and Greater Differentiation)

•  Classification: Martial Arts were formalized into distinct "Styles," each with a unique set of Charms and a distinct philosophical approach to combat. Styles were classified based on their power and the type of energy they drew upon.
  •  Terrestrial Martial Arts: Styles rooted in the traditions of the Dragon-Blooded Houses, often focused on practical combat applications.
  •  Celestial Martial Arts: Styles that tapped into the power of the Celestial Gods and granted superhuman abilities.
  •  Sidereal Martial Arts: Styles specific to the Sidereal Exalted, focused on fate manipulation and strategic combat.
  •  Abyssal Martial Arts: Dark reflections of Celestial Martial Arts, corrupted by the power of the Underworld.
  •  Jadeborn Martial Arts: Martial arts specifically for the Jadeborn as detailed in the book The Compass of Terrestrial Direction, Vol. V - The Blessed Isle.
•  Accessibility:
  •  Mortals: Mortals had access to a few "lesser" Martial Arts Styles, typically those that focused on mundane skills or techniques passed down through families.
  •  Terrestrial Exalted: Terrestrials could learn Terrestrial Martial Arts and, with rare exceptions, could not learn Celestial Martial Arts. They were restricted to the martial arts appropriate for their element.
  •  Celestial Exalted: Celestials had access to all Terrestrial and Celestial Martial Arts, but some were restricted based on their Caste or Anathema status. Lunars had some unique paths, some of which even granted them to make up their own martial arts style. Sidereals had access to Sidereal Martial Arts, which were completely distinct and focused on manipulating fate.
•  Key Features:
  •  Style Prerequisites: Each Style had specific requirements for entry, such as particular Backgrounds or Virtues.
  •  Stances: Many Martial Arts Styles revolved around adopting different stances, each granting unique bonuses and abilities.
  •  Form Weapons: Some Styles were associated with specific weapons, known as "Form Weapons," which granted additional benefits when used in conjunction with the Style.
•  Sources:
  •  Exalted (2nd Edition Core Rulebook): Contains the basic rules for Martial Arts Styles and a selection of common Styles.
  •  Scroll of the Monk: A dedicated supplement focusing on Martial Arts, with dozens of new Styles and expanded rules.
  •  The Books of Sorcery, Vol. II - The White Treatise: adds a martial art style
  •  The Books of Sorcery, Vol. IV - The Roll of Glorious Divinity I: adds a martial art style

## 3rd Edition: (Modular Structure and Greater Customization)

•  Classification: 3rd Edition takes a more modular approach. "Styles" are no longer rigid trees, but instead collections of individual Charms. While the name "Martial Art" remains, the system is more about customizing fighting techniques. There are guidelines on making new styles, allowing for a lot of customization.
  •  Martial Arts: Any charm that has the keyword "Martial Arts". Styles are generally informal organizations of these, as opposed to a rigid pre-determined Charm tree.
•  Accessibility:
  •  Mortals: Mortals can learn Martial Arts Charms, but their limited Essence and ability to learn Charms make it a challenge. They often require significant training or magical assistance.
  •  Terrestrial Exalted: Terrestrials have easier access to Martial Arts, particularly those that align with their Elemental Mastery.
  •  Celestial Exalted: Celestials have the greatest access to Martial Arts Charms, able to learn and customize their fighting styles with greater ease.
•  Key Features:
  •  Keywords: Charms are defined by keywords that determine their effects and interactions.
  •  Stunts: Combat is heavily reliant on stunts, rewarding players for creative and descriptive actions.
  •  Charms as Building Blocks: Rather than fixed Style Trees, Charms are bought individually, allowing players to create their own Styles, as long as they have enough experience points.
•  Sources:
  •  Exalted 3rd Edition Core Rulebook: Contains the foundational rules for Martial Arts Charms and combat.
  •  What Fire has Wrought: Adds a new martial art style.
  •  Hundred Devils Night Parade: Adds a new martial art style.

In summary:

•  1st Edition: Simplest system, broad Charm trees.
•  2nd Edition: Formalized Styles, distinct classifications, limited accessibility.
•  3rd Edition: Modular system, more customization, greater accessibility, reliance on keywords.
# Смертные боевые искусства в 3 редакции

In 3 edition of exalted rpg, could a mortal learn martial arts style enough to teach other person?

ChatGPT4 | Midjourney, [15.04.2025 9:43]
Yes, in the 3rd Edition of Exalted RPG, it is theoretically possible for a mortal to learn a Martial Arts Style well enough to teach it to another person, but there are several caveats and challenges involved:

Challenges and Requirements:

1. Skill Level: The mortal would need an exceptionally high Athletics skill and relevant combat skills (Melee, Brawl, etc.). We're talking Skill 5 with a Specialization related to the Style's movement or signature techniques.

2. Deep Understanding: They wouldn't just need to know how to execute the techniques; they would need a deep understanding of the underlying principles and philosophy of the style. This requires serious study, meditation, and training.

3. Limited Essence: A mortal's limited Essence pool (typically 1) would significantly restrict their ability to use Charms. They would primarily be teaching the form of the Style, not its full Essence-fueled power. It is likely they would not be able to teach a way to make new charms but teach how to use them.

4. Resources and Time: Learning a full Martial Arts Style is a lengthy and demanding process. The mortal would need access to resources, a dedicated teacher (or a way to decipher written texts), and the time to devote themselves to the study.

5. Teaching Ability: Being skilled at a Martial Art does not automatically make someone a good teacher. The mortal would also need good skills in Socialize, Presence or Performance to effectively convey knowledge to others.

6. Circumstances: Most likely the style being taught is not an Exalted specific one.

How it Could Work:

•  A Mortal Master: Imagine a character who dedicated their entire life to mastering a specific, non-Exalted Martial Art style. They could have honed their body and mind to extraordinary levels, developing techniques that rival the abilities of Exalted in some ways. They might teach others the principles of body mechanics, stances, and breathing techniques, but they could never truly replicate the Essence-infused power of an Exalted practitioner. They might be able to teach a few, extremely restricted, charms.

•  Ancient Texts: A mortal scholar could uncover ancient texts detailing a lost Martial Art style. They might spend years deciphering the texts and practicing the techniques, eventually becoming proficient enough to teach others. Again, their teaching would focus on the physical aspects of the style, rather than the magical applications.

•  Exalted Training (Partially): Perhaps a Dragon-Blooded or even a Solar Exalted trained a mortal student in some of the basic techniques of a Martial Art style, carefully stripping away the Essence-based components to create a "mortal version" of the style. This would be a dangerous process, as it could attract unwanted attention and expose the mortal to powers beyond their understanding.

What They Could Teach:

•  Forms and Kata: The sequences of movements that define the style.
•  Basic Combat Techniques: Strikes, blocks, grapples, and other fundamental maneuvers.
•  Stances and Footwork: The proper body positioning and movement patterns.
•  Breathing Exercises: Techniques to control and focus energy (not Essence, but a mortal equivalent).
•  Discipline and Philosophy: The mindset and principles that underpin the style.

What They Couldn't Teach:

•  Charm Activation: The ability to channel Essence to enhance techniques with supernatural effects.
•  Advanced Charms: Complex maneuvers that require superhuman strength, speed, or reflexes.
•  The Essence-Based Core of the Style: The fundamental connection to the power source that makes the style truly potent.

In conclusion:

A mortal could teach a modified, watered-down version of a Martial Art style, but they could never fully convey its Essence-fueled power or teach the full range of Charms. It would be more like teaching a historical fighting style than a true Exalted Martial Art. But in theory, and with a little narrative creativity, it is possible.

# Есть ли в Лукши аналог ниндзя?
That's an interesting question that requires a bit of interpretation. There's no direct "ninja" equivalent in Lookshy as presented in the Exalted RPG lore, meaning no organization explicitly called "ninja" or operating exactly like historical ninja. However, Lookshy does have individuals and groups who fulfill similar roles, embodying elements of stealth, espionage, and assassination.

Here's a breakdown of potential analogs and why they're not exactly ninja:

- **The Swift River Riders**: These are the elite cavalry scouts of Lookshy. They're known for their horsemanship, speed, and ability to navigate dangerous terrain. While they're not primarily focused on stealth, they do perform reconnaissance missions and could be involved in covert operations.
	- *Why not exactly ninja?* They are primarily scouts and couriers rather than assassins or spies. Their strength lies in their speed and mobility, not necessarily in their stealth.
- **The Ghost Squads**: These small, highly trained units specialize in infiltration, sabotage, and assassination. They're known for their ability to move undetected, blend into the environment, and eliminate targets with ruthless efficiency.
	- *Why not exactly ninja?* While they perform similar missions to ninja, their methods are often more direct and less reliant on disguise and deception. They're more like special forces operatives than shadowy assassins. They also don't seem to have as much of a focus on espionage and intelligence gathering.
- **House Tepet's Informants**: House Tepet, known for its political machinations, likely maintains a network of spies and informants throughout Lookshy and beyond. These individuals would gather intelligence, spread rumors, and manipulate events from the shadows.
	- *Why not exactly ninja?* These informants are primarily focused on intelligence gathering and political intrigue, not necessarily combat or assassination. They operate more like spies than ninja.
- **Sidereal Influence**: It's also possible that Sidereal Exalted within Lookshy (or influencing it from afar) use their fate-weaving abilities for covert operations. They could subtly manipulate events, erase memories, and conceal information to achieve their goals.
	- *Why not exactly ninja?* Sidereals operate on a cosmic scale, manipulating fate rather than engaging in direct, physical actions.
- **Individual Dragon-Blooded with Stealth Charms**: Certain Dragon-Blooded Exalted with the right Charms and skills could operate as "ninja-like" individuals. An Air Aspect Dragon-Blooded with Charms like Unseen Passage or Whispering Shadow Form could become a master of stealth and infiltration.
	- *Why not exactly ninja?* This is more about individual skill than a formalized organization with a specific code of conduct.

**Conclusion**:
Lookshy has groups and individuals who perform tasks similar to ninja (espionage, infiltration, assassination), but they don't perfectly match the ninja archetype. Lookshy emphasizes military discipline, elemental mastery, and adherence to duty. This makes Lookshy's approach to covert operations more structured and less reliant on the individualistic, shadowy tactics often associated with ninja. You can find elements that are similar to ninja in Lookshy, but it's never exactly the same.
