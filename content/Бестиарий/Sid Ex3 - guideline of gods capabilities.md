Sev: Working up a npc that is a celestial god of axes used in violence. What would be some good statblocks to pilfer from to get ideas for charms/abilities? I know there is a god of swords in the Sidereals book.
He proably shouldn't be as powerful as that guy, because he isn't god of all axes everywhere.

[7:21]Sokarera: depends how Violency you wanna get
[7:25]Sokarera: One thing to consider is perhaps they have crossover with the Division of Tools, as a liaision maybe, so they have some Ordinary Craft Stuff
[7:26]Sokarera: The Division of Weapons and the Division of Tools are at loggerheads over a lot of stuff
[7:26]Sokarera: Axes that were tools used as weapons is probably a very contentious portfolio


[7:26]MMOVRXYZ: See Sidereals for general guideline of what gods are capable of, depending on essence/purview:
---
Essence 3 to 5, your pick
Primary actions: 12 dice
Secondary actions: 8 dice
Desperate actions: 6 dice

Appearance x up to you, Resolve 3 (probably), Guile X (up to you)

Combat:
Pick a primary Attack: 12 Dice (choose stats for weapon, going to assume will be an artifact axe)
Combat Movement: 8-10 dice (up to you)

Evasion: ? Parry: ?  (Pick one at 4-5 to represent fighting prowess and other at 3)

Soak/Hardness: Up to you, pick artifact armor stats if you want

Merits: List merits

Offensive charms: Keep it at 1 to 3 charms in general
Defensive charms: Keep it at 1 to 3 charms in general
Social charms: Optional 1 to 2, unless very involved
Miscellaneous charms: Everything else, utility and other shenanigans, Hurry Home and Materialization are always included see corebook for details.

To Dice adders or not to dice adders: this is up to you, many beings don't have any dice adders or are very limited. Exigents has the guideline also if a spirit is weak, moderately strong or powerful on how much dice adder should they get. But at the end of the day, thats all there is to it.

[7:30]Sokarera: 'i used to be the god of axes in the division of tools, but then Fransia died fighting against the Crusade, so I got promoted into axes of violence as a liaision between tools and weapons.'

[7:51]Sev: The rough idea was that he was a god who got given a good deal by the Gold Faction to help destabilize the Realm via supporting a patrician criminal organization. The bribe? When the overall leadership is thrown into chaos and the dust settles, the Gold Faction will make sure the axe will supplant the sword as a symbol of the new ruling faction's office, thus upping his importance.
Also, thank you very much everyone for the help in fleshing him out mechanically!
