Anima Flux
The animas of the Dragon-Blooded manifest as roiling auras of elemental power, capable of laying waste to the scenery around them and posing a potent danger to those who’d fight them. This destructive force is known as anima flux. While the Dragon-Blood’s anima is flaring at the **bonfire/iconic level**==, she rolls 1 die on each turn to inflict withering damage on all non-Dragon-Blooded within close range. This die instead inflicts lethal damage to enemies in Initiative Crash and trivial opponents. Anyone with at least hardness 1 ignores anima flux==
