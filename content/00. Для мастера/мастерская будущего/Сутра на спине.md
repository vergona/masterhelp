![[Сутра на спине.png|400]]

Arbane: Anyone know what that says?

Laguz24: I'm not entirely sure it says anything and itsn't just vaguely chinese character art that is jibberish.

[.] : At least a few are real words. The top one appears to be "ren" meaning man.

DivineRubyEmpress: Yeah, it's all real kanji...
	人不為己，天誅地滅
	If man does not (live) for himself, he will be destroyed by heaven and earth.
It's part of the Sutra of Ten Good Deeds. The second half. The whole line is "It is natural and right for people to live for themselves. If people do not live for themselves, they will be punished by heaven and earth." (Here, "live" is a far more moral concept than just "live your life").

VagueZ (they/them): sort of like a "live as you are ordained to" feeling?Or something else?

DivineRubyEmpress: More like "cultivate your life". There's a definite notion of "bettering yourself".

[.] 4 character phrases?

DivineRubyEmpress: Well, the whole line is 4 sets of 4 characters, but our lady uses only the last 2 sets of 4.
The whole line from the sutra is ==「人生為己，天經地義；人不為己，天誅地滅。」==
=="Bettering your life, is natural and right; A person who doesn't better themselves, heaven and earth will destroy them."==
