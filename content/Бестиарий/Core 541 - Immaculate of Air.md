Offensive Charms  
Style **Air Dragon Form** (9m; Simple; Mute, One scene): The Immaculate’s unarmed attacks add +2 withering damage and extend to short range through pulses of air or cutting winds. Chakram attacks convert aim dice to  successes. She adds +1 Evasion and one success on movement actions.  
Style **Breath-Seizing Technique** (3m; Supplemental; Instant; Stackable, Withering-only): withering attack that deals more damage than target’s Stamina inflicts a cumulative -1 penalty on physical actions for the rest of the scene.  
If the penalty rises over a character’s Stamina, they begin to suffocate (p. 232), but only pass out for the rest of the scene, rather than dying, if they run out of air. Each time  the target gains 5+ Initiative from a withering attack, this  penalty decreases by one. 

Style **Avenging Wind Strike** (3m, 1wp; Supplemental; Instant;  Uniform): Double 8s on damage against a close range  enemy and knock them back two range bands to fall  prone. At short range, double 9s and knock back one  range band.  

Style **Wrathful Winds Maneuver** (6m, 3i; Simple; Instant): Shouting or slamming hands together creates a sonic environmental hazard applied against all enemies in medium  range. Hazard is difficulty 3 to resist, damage 3B. Once per fight, unless reset by making a successful decisive  attack and building up to Initiative 13+.
