Offensive Charms 
Style **Air Dragon Form** (9m; Simple; Mute, One scene): The Immaculate’s unarmed attacks add +2 withering damage and extend to short range through pulses of air or cutting winds. Chakram attacks convert aim dice to successes. She adds +1 Evasion and 1 success on movement actions. 
**Aim**: if attack aim on his next turn, gains a +3 bonus. If the target moves out of range or behind full cover (see p. 198) before the character’s next turn, this action is wasted. cannot move and aim during the same round without some form of magic to permit it. This action cannot be placed in a flurry

Style **Breath-Seizing Technique** (3m; Supplemental; Instant; Stackable, Withering-only): withering attack that deals more damage than target’s Stamina inflicts a cumulative -1 penalty on physical actions for the rest of the scene. 
If the penalty rises over a character’s Stamina, they begin to suffocate (p. 232), but only pass out for the rest of the scene, rather than dying, if they run out of air. Each time the target gains 5+ Initiative from a withering attack, this penalty decreases by one. 

Style **Avenging Wind Strike** (3m, 1wp; Supplemental; Instant; Uniform): Double 8s on damage against a close range enemy and knock them back two range bands to fall prone. At short range, double 9s and knock back one range band. 

**Persistent Hornet Attack** (5m, 1wp, expend Air Aura; Simple; One scene; Air, Aura, Withering-only): Make a withering attack, transferring all Initiative from it to chakram, which gains a place in Initiative order and can begin acting the next round. It can aim, take reflexive move actions, and make attacks against enemies within close range using master’s dice pools. It loses 3 Initiative at the end of each round it doesn’t aim or land an attack, and this Charm ends after it makes a decisive attack. It has Defense 4 and soak 4, can be targeted by withering attacks, and can be knocked out of the air with a disarm gambit, ending this Charm.

**Winter Fang Attack** (4m; Supplemental; Instant; Air, Balanced, Decisive-only): If decisive Thrown attack or gambit succeeds, enemy loses Initiative equal to 10s on Initiative roll, maximum 3 (they waisted)

---
Defensive Charms 
Style **Air Dragon’s Sight** (3m; Reflexive; Instant, Perilous): The Immaculate may ignore up to -3 in penalties to her Evasion. Penalties imposed by unexpected attacks are canceled without counting towards the maximum. 
Style **Wind Dragon’s Speed** (4m; Supplemental; Instant): Double 9s on movement action; refuse Initiative cost of successful disengage action if all opposing characters have lower Initiative

**Safety Among Enemies** (5m, 1wp; Reflexive; Instant; Air, Aura, Decisive-only, Perilous): Redirect a decisive dodged attack to another character in range, making a new attack roll with the same pool, as long as his Initiative exceeds the combined sum of his attacker and the new target. 

---
Social Charms 
**Undaunted Dragon Hero** (2i; Reflexive; Instant): The Dragon-Blooded resists the blandishments and temptation of his foes on the battlefield. Add +1 Resolve against influence that does not align with an Intimacy, or +1 Resolve against influence that opposes a Major or Defining Intimacy. These bonuses stack
**Clear-Eyed Courtier’s Scrutiny** (10m, 1wp; Simple; Instant; Air, Mute): Roll Read Intentions with double 9s against all characters in a scene. Once per day. 
**Foul Stench of Lies Discernment** (3m, 1wp; Reflexive; Instant; Air, Mute): Roll Investigation with three non-Charm dice against a character’s Guile when he speaks to determine if he’s lying. Waive Willpower cost for subsequent uses once a lie’s been found.

## Лалайя
**Willpower**: Most spells cost at least one point of Willpower, as it takes a significant investment of the sorcerer’s will to grasp and wield the Essence of the cosmos. This cost must be paid up front, when the sorcerer first begins shaping the spell. **If the spell is cast successfully**, the realization of the sorcerer’s design fulfills her, r**estoring one point of Willpower spent to fuel the spell**. If the spell is lost, aborted, or countered, then all spent Willpower is simply lost.
**Shaping Ritual**: Once per scene, when stunts the first Shape Sorcery roll of a spell with invocations or mudras, he gains (stunt rating + 2) sorcerous motes toward completing the spell. 

- **Cirrus Skiff** (15sm, 1wp; Until ended) -3 хода
Summon a flying cloud capable of traveling at ESSx6 miles per hour, using Sorcery for movement rolls in combat. The spell ends if spends more than a scene off the cloud.

- **Death of Obsidian Butterflies** (15sm, 1wp; Decisive-only; Instant): 
Roll Sorcery: 10 dice (+6 for 6m) as an undodgeable **decisive** attack against everyone in a line out to medium range (шириной в 1 зону и высотой в short range of the ground)
(battle groups take -2 Defense). 
Roll (3 + extra successes)L damage, or (8 + extra successes) L damage against battle groups. This doesn’t reset Initiative. 
obsidian butterflies fall to the ground and shatter, creating terrain that may be hazardous for barefooted characters to traverse—treat as an **environmental hazard inflicting 2 dice of lethal, diff 2 to resist with a (Dexterity + Athletics) rol** l, and if the character is barefoot, difficult terrain as well. Any character wearing armored boots can generally ignore the debris

- **Infallible Messenger** (5sm, 2wp; Control) -2 хода
Conjure a cherub to deliver a message up to five minutes long to a single individual anywhere in Creation, reaching him within a day. Can convey social influence, but not social Charms. For a one-Willpower surcharge, may extend her senses through the cherub and make Senses rolls through it.

- **Demon of 1st Circle** (Ritual, 2wp) -3 хода
ritual that begins at sundown, and ends at the stroke of midnight. A faint green glow traces out a rift between Creation and Hell, and a First Circle Demon of the sorcerer’s choice is drawn forth, howling with rage, fear, or sorrow.

# Томеску, облачный арсенал (100DevPar)

Томеску, Гремящие Арсеналы-Облака, потомство Живой Башни.
![[00_A Tomescu 2.png]]
Говорят, что в момент рождения томеску осознает и момент смерти. Образ собственной смертности впечатывается в сознание, и каждый томеску вскрикивает от боли дважды в день. В Творении эти крики приходят на закате и рассвете. 
Облик томеску нельзя различить, ибо каждый из них постоянно окружен толстым туманом, из которого выглядывает множество многосуставчатых конечностей, каждая из которых защищена зеленым инсектоидным щитком, и обычно кончается неким оружием, растущим из последнего сустава – мечами, секирами, кувалдами. Немногие конечности заканчиваются луками, а прилегающие к ним – рукообразными отростками, способными удержать стрелу.
Древние тексты говорят, что истинный облик томеску напоминает смесь краба и богомола, а десятки конечностей хаотично выступают по всему телу. Томеску не любят насилия, и живут как живут, со внутренним осознанием собственной смертности… но они весьма сведущи в бою. Каждый из этого народа рождается с оружием наготове и сверхъестественным умением им пользоваться.
Несмотря на сомнительное отношение к битвам, обычно чародеи именно для них томеску и призывают. Иногда томеску втягивается в Творение, когда запутывается судьба. К несчастью для гремящих арсеналов-облаков, зачастую для расследования этого являются и Сторонние, и потому побег демона обычно кратковременен.

Tomescu may have other kinds of weapon limbs in add to common ones listed here
MERITS
- **Ten Thousand Deadly Limb**s: Each of the tomescu’s limbs ends in a weapon. These are grown from the demon’s own carapace and cannot be broken or disarmed except with attacks that would sever a limb.
OFFENSIVE CHARMS
- **Principle of Motion** (10m, 1wp; Reflexive; Instant; Essence 2): The tomescu moves with blinding speed, taking a flurry without the usual restrictions. It can flurry two of the same action if desired, and it ignores the usual penalties to dice pools and Defense.
- **Furious Thousand-Armed Counter** (3m; Reflexive; Instant; Counterattack, Withering-only; Essence 1): After the tomescu has applied its Parry defense but before damage is rolled, it makes a withering counterattack with its choice of weapon limb. Successes on this damage roll reduce the target’s Initiative one-for-one. The first time in a turn it uses this ability against a particular opponent, it doesn’t pay the mote cost. 
DEFENSIVE CHARMS
- **Many-Limbed Interception** (2m; Reflexive; Instant; Essence 1): Ignore all penalties to Parry Defense against a single attack. The first time in a turn it uses this ability against a particular opponent, it doesn’t pay the mote cost.
MISCELLANEOUS CHARMS
- **Foretell the Future** (10m, 1wp; Simple; One scene; Essence 2): In Malfeas, the tomescu read the wind and listen to the whispers hidden behind ever-present songs, and know the Yozis’ wishes. In Creation, they do their best to guess, finding the former World-Makers’ thumbprints in hidden places. As long as a summoner follows a tomescu’s predictions, she gains +4 bonus dice to relevant actions.
- **Hurry Home** (10m; Simple; Instant; Essence 1): The demon returns to its summoner’s side; unavailable when unbound.
- **Materialize** (35m, 1wp; Simple; Instant; Essence 1): Weaving itself from broken weapon shards and wailing doom, the tomescu takes physical shape.
- **Measure the Wind** (5m, Simple; Instant; Essence 1): The tomescu can read anyone who faces it in combat.
- **Natural Prognostication** (1m; Reflexive; Simple; Essence 1): Unbidden, the tomescu howls of misfortune doomed to be befall a target (often paranoid summoners). This is expressed as a one-sentence statement of something that may come to pass. If following a tomescu’s prediction helps a character avoid misfortune, she regains one Willpower point, loses one Limit if applicable, and forms a Minor Tie of trust to all tomescu (or strengthens an existing Tie by one step). Once per story.
