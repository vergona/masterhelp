# Противники-смертные
## Brigand / Conscript / Militia
The distinctions between village militia, conscripts, and bandits are political and situational. By and large, they’re ill-equipped, have little to no training, and would rather go back to their farms or shops than fight.

## Battle-Ready Troops / Medium Infantry 
Footsoldiers include well-trained militia, solidly equipped peasant levies, and mercenaries. Few city-states can afford to maintain standing armies indefinitely, so common troops spend much of the year in agricultural labor, going to war only between harvests or when princes can afford wartime pay. Unpaid soldiers often turn to banditry. 
Most Realm legionnaires are peasant volunteers seeking a hot meal and a roof over their heads, but caught stealing rice to feed her husband and daughter, Rain Plum chose the legions over the shaming her family would face 
if she went under the lash. Now she serves stolidly, waiting only for her term’s end so she can go home. 
Rain Plum is a soldier, not a warrior. She obeys military discipline and fights in formation with her fang, all of them equipped with long spear, chopping sword, tower shield, reinforced buff jacket and pot helmet. Though loyal to her officers and fangmates, if faced with overwhelming odds she will surrender or flee rather than fight to the death.

## Lintha Reaver / Brigand Leader / Grizzled Mercenary 
Not every brigand is a starveling peasant who barely knows which end of the spear to point. Even without formal training, years of fighting—and perhaps a little talent—can harden an ordinary bandit or soldier into a ruthless killer.

## Elite Troops / Champion / Elite Bodyguard 
Military elites receive the finest arms and training, the better to support their role as shock troops or personal guards. Some are handpicked from the citizenry for size and strength, or from the rank and file for skill and valor. Others are raised for war—usually social elites groomed for great things, or indoctrinated janissary slaves.

## Monk / Warrior-Priest 
It’s not uncommon for religious orders, from the Immaculate Order to sizable threshold cults, to provide their members with martial training. This is, to some extent, an ascetic or meditative exercise. It also helps priests and monks protect their temples and flocks, oftimes by passing along their training to the peasantry.

## Assassin / Spymaster
