**Aqueous Rebirth** (5m, 1i; Reflexive; Instant; Essence 1): Afondha briefly dissolves into water. She may automatically succeed on a disengage attempt. Alternatively, she may roll Dexterity + Cult (7 dice) while being grappled to reduce the opponent‚Äôs turns of control by the number of successes she rolls. If this reduces the turns of control to zero, she gains two Initiative.

**Still Waters Run Deep** (5m, 2i; Reflexive; Instant; Withering-only; Essence 1): Afondha gains bonus soak equal to the number of dice that show failures in the attack roll, or double that amount if she is partially or fully submerged in her aquifer‚Äôs water. Activate this Charm before the attacker rolls

**Ripples-on-Water Defense** (4m; Reflexive; Instant; Aura, Dual): Against a withering attack roll, up to four 1s subtract successes. Against a decisive attack roll, up to four 1s reroll successes, starting with 7s and going up

**River-Drinking Renewal** (30m, 1wp; Simple; Instant; Perilous; Essence 6): Fakharu may drain the water from a large cistern, lake, river, or similar body of water within medium range in order to heal wounds, rolling his Initiative and healing levels of damage equal to the successes.
